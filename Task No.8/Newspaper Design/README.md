I recently had a newspaper-like design that featured multiple row and column spans with divider lines in between them. Take a
look at the mockup graphic here and see if it makes you sweat at all. If you’re like me, you have been around a while and know just
how difficult this would have been with old layout techniques

The project came with a few requirements:
Show the outlines of the grid
Designable and understandable news
Columns can be wider, or longer than others
Simple and a plain newspaper
Divider lines must be shown between the various blocks
