Callbacks are just the name of a convention for using JavaScript functions. There isn't a special thing called a 'callback' in the
JavaScript language, it's just a convention. Instead of immediately returning some result like most functions, functions that use
callbacks take some time to produce a result. The word 'asynchronous', aka 'async' just means 'takes some time' or 'happens in the
future, not right now'. Usually callbacks are only used when doing I/O, e.g. downloading things, reading files, talking to databases,
etc
