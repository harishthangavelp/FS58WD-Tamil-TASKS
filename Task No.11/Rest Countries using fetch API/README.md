The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible
replacement for XMLHttpRequest. The Fetch API uses Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests),
as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics. You can create a request and response directly using the
Request() and Response() constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of
other API actions (for example, FetchEvent.respondWith() from service workers).
